			<h2>Who is this?</h2>
			<p>
				I am an independent software developer.<br>
				I am not exactly a researcher, but I have this passion for understanding and learning about things. My current research interests are rather broad and loosely connected.
			</p>
			<ul type=square>
				<li>Space and rocket science
				<li>Language and Linguistics
				<li>Dating and Social Dynamics
				<li>The Science of Human Learning
			</ul>
			<p>
				I focus on the practical applications of mine and others' ideas. Hit me up through e-mail at contact@kubis.tech if you'd like to work with me to help develop your ideas or put them into practice.
